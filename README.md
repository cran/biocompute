Seven Bridges implementation of the BioCompute Object (BCO) specification. Offers the capabilities to compose, validate, and convert BioCompute Objects with R.

Users can encode information in data frames, and compose BioCompute Objects from the domains defined by the standard. A checksum validator and a JSON schema validator are provided. This package also supports exporting BioCompute Objects as JSON, PDF, HTML, or Word documents, and exporting to cloud-based platforms.

Check out the [introduction vignette](https://sbg.github.io/biocompute/articles/intro.html) or the [case study vignette](https://sbg.github.io/biocompute/articles/case-study.html) to get started.
