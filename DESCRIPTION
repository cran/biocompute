Description: Tools to create, validate, and export BioCompute Objects
    described in King et al. (2019) <doi:10.17605/osf.io/h59uh>.
    Users can encode information in data frames, and compose
    BioCompute Objects from the domains defined by the standard.
    A checksum validator and a JSON schema validator are provided.
    This package also supports exporting BioCompute Objects as JSON,
    PDF, HTML, or 'Word' documents, and exporting to cloud-based platforms.
